    "The purpuse of this project is to see the relationship between the GDP and the unemployment rate in U.S. In this project, we have time series data of the GDP and the unemployment rate for the U.S. According to the theory, the GDP and the unemployment rate has a negative relationship. We will use linear regression analysis to test whether the GDP will influence the unemployment rate. "

To test the hypothesis a linear regression will be preformed and the results will be stated. Finally, there will be a discussion of the test results and whether or not it follows previous scholarship."
